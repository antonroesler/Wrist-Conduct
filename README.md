This is the code to our paper "WristConduct: Biometric User Authentication Using Bone Conduction at the Wrist"

## Abstract
User authentication is an essential security requirement in all personal electronic devices. While smartphones and laptops
can already be unlocked with user biometrics, this is not yet common for smartwatches and other wrist-worn wearables. In
this paper, we show that it is possible to identify and thereby authenticate users by analyzing soundwaves that were passed
through their wrist bones using bone conduction. In a feasibility study, we took 10 recordings of 24 subjects to create a dataset.
Using a deep neural network, our method shows an authentication accuracy of 98.7%.
